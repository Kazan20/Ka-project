Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was a small village.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
He who laughs last laughs best.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
A watched pot never boils.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Haste makes waste.
Ignorance is bliss.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Many hands make light work.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No pain, no gain.
Old habits die hard.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Patience is a virtue.
The best things in life are free.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
There's no place like home.
Time heals all wounds.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two heads are better than one.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You reap what you sow.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Actions speak louder than words.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Blood is thicker than water.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
Every dog has its day.
Fortune favors the bold.
Honesty is the best policy.
If you can't beat them, join them.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
It takes two to tango.
Knowledge is power.
Look before you leap.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No man is an island.
Once bitten, twice shy.
Opportunity knocks but once.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
The early bird catches the worm.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Time and tide wait for no man.
To err is human, to forgive divine.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Variety is the spice of life.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
